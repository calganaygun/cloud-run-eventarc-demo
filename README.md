# Eventarc, Cloud Run, Vision AI API, and Cloud Storage Demo

This demo shows how to use Eventarc to trigger a Cloud Run service when a new image is uploaded to Cloud Storage. The Cloud Run service uses Vision AI API to detect labels, and landmarks in the image and stores the results in an Algolia index.
